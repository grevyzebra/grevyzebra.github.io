							<ul>
								<li>FB has an impact on human relationships</li>
								<li>can expand the communication possibilities and could have an influence on people’s relationships (33 % of all divorces in Great Britain)</li>
								<li>can have almost all characteristics then interpersonal relationships</li>
								<li>there are also differences in the intensity and the familiarity when writing with each other</li>
								<li>also the three phases could apply to Facebook</li>

						<h2>three phases</h2>
							<p class="fragment roll-in">Phase 1: meet -> friendship</p>
							<p class="fragment roll-in">Phase 2: already “friends” -> through messages this friendship could be sustained</p>

						<h1>Impact of Facebook on the communication in the offline world</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>old Studies say -> Danger of social isolation !</li>
							<li>New studies -> provided that there is no reduction of the communication activities</li>
							<li>Question: Does facebook has influence on contacts which were founded in offline life?</li>
							<li>But Difference: Weak and strong Relationships!</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							Facebook supports more the weak Relationships, e.g. old acquaintances
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							Strong Relationships: Family -> strong enough, dont need support through Facebook
						</p>
						<p>
							Contact with strong relationship: face-to-face or SMS
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							Facebooks effect on :
							Strong Relationships: neither good nor bad ->neutral
						</p>
						<p>
							Weak Relationship: positive and helpful, keep in touch with acquaintance
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Fact</h2>
						<p>
							Facebook doesn’t retardant the affect of communication in the offline world, but it gives the possibility to re- contact people.<br><br>

							It has rather more a positive effect: Friendlist dominated by weak Relationships, but they could be conversation topic between stron Relationships = positive effect on communication<br><br>

							Through Fcabeook social relationships could be strengthened and built up.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Another Aspect</h2>
						<p>
							But another Study says, that facebook is dominated by jealousy, social tension, isolation and depression. And envy: comparing themselfs to other people from their age group. Its just the case for teenagers !

						<h1>Relationship between all of your Facebook friends still possible?</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Is it still possible to have a personal relationship to all of your Facebook friends ?</h2>
						<p>
							Study: Is the number of written messages rising with the number of friends in the friendlist ?
							<br><br>
							saturation point -> 200 contacts in friendslist<br>
							as more friends, the less messages!<br>
							over 200 friends: less messages<br>
							less 200 friends: more messages<br>
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							shows that there is just a small part of real personal relationships = people who you write messages with.<br>The rest of the people is not important enough to write with.<br><br>

							differ between kind of relationships: more personal when you write messages, more unpersonal when they are just friends in the friendlist.<br><br>

							<strong>result:</strong> There are still relationships to all of your facebook friends, but you have to differ between strong and weak ones.
