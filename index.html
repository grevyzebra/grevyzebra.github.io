					<h1>Introduction</h1>
					<p>
						We selected Facebook as a topic because it’s something that is affecting us all.                                         
						We all have Facebook – we are guilty of using it far too often – we wonder what are the effects of using Facebook and how does it affect us as a society.                      
						We wanted to find out what impacts are there on youth, it seems that it’s considered a necessity among young people.

					<section>
						<p>
							<ul>
								<li>FB has an impact on human relationships</li>
								<li>can expand the communication possibilities and could have an influence on people’s relationships (33 % of all divorces in Great Britain)</li>
								<li>can have almost all characteristics then interpersonal relationships</li>
								<li>there are also differences in the intensity and the familiarity when writing with each other</li>
								<li>also the three phases could apply to Facebook</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>three phases</h2>
							<p class="fragment roll-in">Phase 1: meet -> friendship</p>
							<p class="fragment roll-in">Phase 2: already “friends” -> through messages this friendship could be sustained</p>
							<p class="fragment roll-in">Phase 3: friends/couple -> stop communicate with each other (breakup)</p>

						<h1>Impact of Facebook on the communication in the offline world</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>old Studies say -> Danger of social isolation !</li>
							<li>New studies -> provided that there is no reduction of the communication activities</li>
							<li>Question: Does facebook has influence on contacts which were founded in offline life?</li>
							<li>But Difference: Weak and strong Relationships!</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							Facebook supports more the weak Relationships, e.g. old acquaintances
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							Strong Relationships: Family -> strong enough, dont need support through Facebook
						</p>
						<p>
							Contact with strong relationship: face-to-face or SMS
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							Facebooks effect on :
							Strong Relationships: neither good nor bad ->neutral
						</p>
						<p>
							Weak Relationship: positive and helpful, keep in touch with acquaintance
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Fact</h2>
						<p>
							Facebook doesn’t retardant the affect of communication in the offline world, but it gives the possibility to re- contact people.<br><br>

							It has rather more a positive effect: Friendlist dominated by weak Relationships, but they could be conversation topic between stron Relationships = positive effect on communication<br><br>

							Through Fcabeook social relationships could be strengthened and built up.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Another Aspect</h2>
						<p>
							But another Study says, that facebook is dominated by jealousy, social tension, isolation and depression. And envy: comparing themselfs to other people from their age group. Its just the case for teenagers !

						<h1>Relationship between all of your Facebook friends still possible?</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Is it still possible to have a personal relationship to all of your Facebook friends ?</h2>
						<p>
							Study: Is the number of written messages rising with the number of friends in the friendlist ?
							<br><br>
							saturation point -> 200 contacts in friendslist<br>
							as more friends, the less messages!<br>
							over 200 friends: less messages<br>
							less 200 friends: more messages<br>
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							shows that there is just a small part of real personal relationships = people who you write messages with.<br>The rest of the people is not important enough to write with.<br><br>

							differ between kind of relationships: more personal when you write messages, more unpersonal when they are just friends in the friendlist.<br><br>

							<strong>result:</strong> There are still relationships to all of your facebook friends, but you have to differ between strong and weak ones.

						<h1>Impact of Facebook on personal relationships</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							According to Debate.Org – 83% of people answered yes to, “Is Facebook actually hurting relationships rather than helping them?” (Debate, 2014) <br><br>

							Prior to the social network era, people developed relationships face-to-face. Face-to-face interaction allowed a person to respond in conversation by applying verbal and non-verbal clues while in face-to-face conversation. <br><br>

							Using Facebook - we cannot convey these messages through Facebook, the only way is interpreting the message with written communication only. However, many people use Facebook as a way to stay in contact, while others use the medium as a way to develop new connections. <br><br>

						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							A benefit of Facebook or any social websites it allows people to develop or maintain relationships with individuals who may not be close to themselves geographically. When it comes to location, social networking websites allow families, couples, and friends stay connected using a simple click of a button. Facebook has video calling now, therefore making the contact more personal.<br><br>
							What about long term? Marshall, Bejanyan, DiCastro, and Lee (2012) argued that “Facebook claimed to keep people connected but the challenges faced by romantic relationships were unknown” and long term were not successful. 
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							We believe that Facebook does not significantly help or harm relationships. It’s the quality of the relationship is dependent upon the human user. They have the power to who interacts in either a positive or negative way with fellow users through the site. So, the impact of Facebook is seen to be a positive in short terms, but on a longer term basis, it’s more difficult and this is when problems arise.

							<ul>
								<li>Primary Task is to maintain relationships that exist also in offline life</li>
								<li>Most of them are weak relationships or persons that you haven´t seen for a long time</li>
								
								<li>for most of the teenagers/young adults it is more important to find old “friends” than to make new ones</li>
							</ul>

							<blockquote>MacArthur Foundation (2008): "Most youth use online networks to extend the friendship did They navigate in the familiar context of school, religious Organizations, sports, and loval other activities. They can be, always on ', in constant contact With Their friends through (...) social network sites: such as MySpace or Facebook," </blockquote>
